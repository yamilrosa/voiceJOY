# voiceJOY

> voiceJOY is a web app that can help those who are mute, have a speech disorder, or have suffered a vocal injury communicate with voice-activated devices like Alexa, Google and Siri.

I am currently building a React versione of this app. [Here is the current web app built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://yamilrosa.com/voicejoy.html).
